# Hello World API - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Root Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `GET /`
- **Description**: Return a welcome message indicating the API is running
- **Input**: None
- **Output**: JSON with message field
- **Response Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Hello from Context Hive minimal example"
  }
  ```
- **Status Code**: 200 OK
- **Validation**: None required

### FR2: Health Check Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `GET /health`
- **Description**: Return health status for monitoring/deployment checks
- **Input**: None
- **Output**: JSON with status field
- **Response Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "ok"
  }
  ```
- **Status Code**: 200 OK
- **Validation**: None required

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Response time < 100ms for both endpoints
- Support at least 100 concurrent requests
- Startup time < 5 seconds

### NFR2: Simplicity
- Total code < 50 lines (excluding tests and docs)
- No external dependencies beyond FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Single file implementation acceptable

### NFR3: Documentation
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation available at `/docs`
- Code includes basic comments explaining Context Hive connection
- README links to Context Hive docs

### NFR4: Testability
- Both endpoints must have tests
- Tests verify response format and status codes
- Test coverage > 80%

### NFR5: Clarity
- Code follows PEP 8 style guide
- Variable names are descriptive
- No clever/obscure Python tricks
- Junior developer can understand immediately

## Constraints
- Must use Python 3.8+
- Must use FastAPI framework (for auto-documentation)
- No database required
- No authentication required
- Single server deployment

## Priorities

**Must Have (P0)**:
- FR1: Root endpoint
- FR2: Health endpoint
- NFR5: Code clarity

**Should Have (P1)**:
- NFR1: Performance < 100ms
- NFR4: Tests with good coverage

**Nice to Have (P2)**:
- NFR3: Additional documentation
- Example request/response in README

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8 or higher
- FastAPI (latest stable)
- Uvicorn (ASGI server for FastAPI)
- pytest (for testing)

## Use Cases

### UC1: Developer Learning Context Hive
**Actor**: Developer new to Context Hive
**Goal**: Understand how docs lead to implementation
**Flow**:
1. Read the 4 Context Hive documents (vision, requirements, design, rules)
2. Review the implementation code
3. Observe that code matches documented decisions
4. Run the API locally
5. Verify endpoints work as specified

**Success**: Developer understands Context Hive workflow

### UC2: Automated Health Check
**Actor**: Deployment system
**Goal**: Verify API is running
**Flow**:
1. Send GET request to `/health`
2. Receive 200 OK with {"status": "ok"}
3. Confirm service is healthy

**Success**: Health check passes, service is marked healthy
