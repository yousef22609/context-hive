# Hello World API - Vision

## Problem Statement
People learning Context Hive methodology need a concrete, working example to understand the workflow. Abstract explanations are not enough - developers learn best by seeing a complete implementation from documentation to code.

## Target Users
- Developers new to Context Hive
- Teams evaluating Context Hive for adoption
- Students learning AI-driven development practices
- Technical writers creating Context Hive tutorials

## Core Value Proposition
A minimal but complete example that demonstrates Context Hive in action: 4 documents leading to working code in under 30 minutes. This example prioritizes clarity and simplicity over features.

## Success Criteria
1. Complete Context Hive documentation (vision, requirements, design, rules)
2. Working FastAPI implementation matching the documentation
3. Code is under 50 lines total (excluding tests)
4. Can be understood by a junior developer in < 15 minutes
5. Demonstrates clear link between docs and implementation

## Out of Scope (v1)
- Real business logic (this is a learning example)
- Database persistence
- Authentication
- Complex features
- Production deployment configuration
- Performance optimization

## Future Vision
This example could evolve into:
- Tutorial series building progressively complex features
- Different language/framework implementations
- Video walkthrough of Context Hive workflow
- Interactive documentation

However, v1 must stay absolutely minimal to demonstrate core concepts without distraction.
