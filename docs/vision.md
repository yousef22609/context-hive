# Vision: Context Hive

## 背景
- AI が断片的なコンテキストしか受け取れず、品質や一貫性が安定しない現状を解決したい。
- Day 0 から AI をチームメンバーとして参加させ、ドキュメントを中核に据える必要がある。

## 目的
- コンテキストに基づく意思決定を AI に委任し、開発速度と品質を同時に高める。
- ヒト/AI 双方が迷わず参照できる生きたドキュメント体系を維持する。

## 適用範囲
- 新規開発またはドキュメント駆動のチームを対象にした AI コラボレーション手法。
- 10〜100 サービス規模、継続期間 3 ヶ月以上のプロジェクトを想定。

## 前提
- ドキュメント作成に投資できる体制であること。
- チームが AI を共同開発者として受け入れるマインドセットを持っていること。

## 変更管理
- Vision の更新は他ドキュメント（Requirements/Design/Rules）との整合性レビュー後に実施する。
- 更新履歴を Pull Request と codex audit レポートで追跡し、最新状態を保証する。

## Problem Statement

Modern software development struggles with AI integration. Current approaches treat AI as a code completion tool rather than a true collaborator. This leads to:

- **Context fragmentation**: AI receives snippets without understanding the full picture
- **Inconsistent quality**: AI makes decisions without knowing project goals and standards
- **Limited autonomy**: Developers must constantly guide AI at a granular level
- **Documentation debt**: Documentation is written after code, quickly becoming outdated

The fundamental problem: **AI is added as a tool, not designed in as a team member from Day 0.**

## Target Users

Context Hive is designed for:

### Primary Users
- **Development teams** (2-10 developers) building medium-to-large projects
- **Technical leads** who want to scale their team's productivity with AI
- **Startups** building greenfield projects with limited resources
- **Engineering teams** that value documentation and architectural clarity

### User Characteristics
- Comfortable with documentation-first approaches
- Open to AI collaboration beyond code completion
- Building projects with 10-100 services
- Value maintainability and consistency
- Working on projects lasting 3+ months

### Not For
- Solo developers on hobby projects (<5 files)
- Teams working on legacy codebases (retrofitting is hard)
- Exploratory prototypes where requirements are unknown
- Teams unwilling to invest in upfront documentation

## Desired Outcome

Context Hive aims to achieve:

### For Development Teams
1. **AI as true team member**: AI understands project vision, architecture, and standards from Day 0
2. **Autonomous implementation**: AI can implement entire features with minimal guidance
3. **Consistent quality**: All AI-generated code follows project standards and design
4. **Reduced onboarding time**: New team members (human or AI) get up to speed quickly
5. **Living documentation**: Documentation remains accurate as the source of truth

### For AI Agents
1. **Complete context**: Access to comprehensive project context through reading lists
2. **Clear guidance**: Explicit task definitions with acceptance criteria
3. **Dependency clarity**: Understanding of what documents to read and in what order
4. **Validation feedback**: Tools to verify context consistency before implementation

### For the Industry
1. **Methodology sharing**: Open-source framework for AI-native development
2. **Best practices**: Documented patterns for successful AI collaboration
3. **Realistic expectations**: Honest sharing of both successes and failures
4. **Scalability data**: Real-world evidence of where the approach works and doesn't

## Project Scope

### In Scope

**Methodology**

## Philosophical Foundation

### Core Beliefs

**AI as Collaborator, Not Tool**
We believe AI should be designed into projects from Day 0, not added later as an afterthought.

**Documentation as Design**
Writing comprehensive documentation before coding isn't busywork—it's the design process itself.

**Simplicity Over Features**
Static files and simple Python scripts beat complex frameworks for most use cases.

**Honest About Limits**
We openly share failures and limitations. Not every project should use Context Hive.

**Community-Driven**
The methodology evolves through real-world usage and community feedback, not theoretical perfection.

### What We're NOT Building

- **Not another AI coding assistant**: We're not building Copilot or Cursor
- **Not an agent framework**: We're not building AutoGPT or LangChain
- **Not a documentation generator**: We're not building automated doc tools
- **Not a project management system**: We're not replacing Jira or Linear

We're building a **methodology and minimal tooling** to enable AI as a true team member.

## Success Looks Like...

**For a developer using Context Hive:**
```
Day 0: Write vision, requirements, design, rules (2-3 days)
Day 1: Generate dependency graph, validate context
Day 2: Create first service, define tasks
Day 3: AI implements first feature autonomously
Day 4: Review and iterate, AI understands corrections
Week 2: AI is implementing features with 90% accuracy
Month 1: AI feels like a junior developer who "gets it"
Month 3: Team velocity has increased 40%
```

**For a team lead:**
- New developers onboard in days instead of weeks
- Architectural decisions are documented and followed
- Code quality is consistent across the team
- AI handles implementation while humans focus on design

**For the industry:**
- AI-native development becomes a recognized practice
- Documentation-first approaches gain wider adoption
- Teams share their Context Hive experiences openly
- The gap between AI capability and usage narrows

## This Vision Drives Everything

Every decision in Context Hive—from the 4-pillar document structure to the Hub architecture—stems from this vision of making AI a true team member from Day 0.

When in doubt about a feature or approach, we return to this vision and ask:
- Does this help AI understand project context better?
- Does this make humans and AI collaborate more effectively?
- Does this maintain simplicity and accessibility?
- Does this stay honest about limitations?

If the answer is no, it doesn't belong in Context Hive.
