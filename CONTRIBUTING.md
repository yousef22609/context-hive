## How to Contribute

### Quick Contributions (No PR needed)
For small fixes and suggestions:
1. Open an issue describing the improvement
2. We'll discuss and potentially implement

### Standard Contributions (PR workflow)
For substantial changes:

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/context-hive.git
   cd context-hive
   ```

2. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-contribution-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing document structure
   - Maintain consistent tone (practical, honest, no hype)
   - Test examples work as documented

4. **Commit with clear messages**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add case study for e-commerce API project"
   ```

5. **Push and create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-contribution-name
   ```
   Then open PR on GitHub

### Case Study Contributions
To contribute a case study:

1. Create file in `case-studies/YYYY-MM-project-name.md`
2. Use the template in `case-studies/_TEMPLATE.md`
3. Be honest - failures are as valuable as successes
4. Anonymize if needed, but keep technical details accurate
5. Include artifacts if possible (sanitized docs)

### Template Contributions
To improve or add templates:

1. Existing templates: Submit changes to `template/*/`
2. New templates: Create new directory under `template/`
3. Include:
   - `README.md` explaining when to use
   - `docs/templates.md` with all 4 core document templates
   - Example or reference implementation

### Example Contributions
To add new examples:

1. Create directory under `examples/your-example-name/`
2. Include complete set:
   - `README.md` explaining the example
   - `docs/` with all 4 core documents
   - `src/` with working implementation
   - `tests/` if applicable
3. Ensure it runs successfully
4. Document setup steps clearly

## Contribution Guidelines

## What Gets Merged

### High Priority (Fast Review)
- Case studies with real data
- Bug fixes in existing docs
- Clarifications and improvements
- Working examples with complete docs

### Medium Priority
- New templates for common scenarios
- Tool integrations
- Translations
- Visual aids and diagrams

### Low Priority (May Take Time)
- Speculative additions
- Unproven patterns
- Large refactorings
- Experimental features

### Won't Merge
- AI-generated content without human review
- Marketing or promotional material
- Off-topic contributions
- Proprietary tools or lock-in

## Case Study Anonymization

If sharing proprietary projects:

### What to Anonymize
- Company names
- Product names
- Customer names
- Specific business metrics
- Internal tools and systems
- People names (except with permission)

### What to Keep Accurate
- Technology stack
- Project scale (file count, team size)
- Timeline and duration
- Technical challenges
- Results and outcomes
- Code patterns and architecture

### Example
```
‚ùå "We built Acme Corp's customer portal using their internal XYZ framework"
‚úÖ "We built an enterprise customer portal using a proprietary Java framework"
```
